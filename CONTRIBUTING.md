## MonkDB Contributor Agreement

To contribute to this project, we need you to agree to our [CLA agreement](./CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md) in the root of our project for the first commit you make. By agreeing to the CLA, we can add you to list of approved contributors and review the changes proposed by you.

## How you can contribute to MonkDB

You can contribute to any open-source MonkDB project. View our [**GitHub page**](https://github.com/monkdbofficial) to see all the different projects. If you encounter a bug or have an improvement suggestion, you can [**submit an issue**](https://github.com/monkdbofficial/monkdb/issues/new) describing your proposed change.

## Submitting a pull request

We have listed out PR instructions in [PR instructions document](./PULL_REQUEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md). Please ensure they are being followed for seamless operation.

## Committing

We prefer squash or rebase commits so that all changes from a branch are committed to master as a single commit. All pull requests are squashed when merged, but rebasing prior to merge gives you better control over the commit message.

## Getting help

For any questions, concerns, or queries, you may send them over to [support@monkdb.com](mailto:support@monkdb.com).

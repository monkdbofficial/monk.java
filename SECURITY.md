# Security Reporting

Thank you in advance for helping us keep MonkDB secure!

Please report any security issues or vulnerabilities to [security@monkdb.com](mailto:security@monkdb.com), before proceeding to post them publicly as issues on GitHub or any other public channels. These issues might also affect other users, and security vulnerabilities need to be handled quickly and sometimes privately.

We will triage the issue, contact you for further instructions and make sure to take any necessary measures as needed.
